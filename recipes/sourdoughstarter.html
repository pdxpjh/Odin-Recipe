    <h2>Simple Sourdough starter from scratch.</h2>
    <p>A sourdough starter is like a pet, you have to feed it, clean up after it, and most of all love it.
        just kidding about that last part but a starter is a living organism! Luckily it eats on the cheap. Just flour
        and water. If you're curious about a common myth about sourdough starters and where the yeast that forms them lives,
         you can read about it <a href = "https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/sourdough2.htm">here</a>. </p>

    <h2>What you will need</h2>
    <p>You won't need much. Gather these items and let's get to work</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A digital scale</li>
            <li>A high-walled quart container, like the ones from takeout food</li>
            <li>A bag of whole wheat, or rye flour</li>
            <li>Filtered water</li>
            <li>Time</li>
    
        </ul>
    <h2>Starting your starter</h2>
        <p>This process is very rinse and repeat. Stick with it and use a high quality flour and you'll have results soon enough</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Fill your quart container with 250 grams of flour</li>
        <li>Add 350 grams of water and stir until smooth</li>
        <li>Let mixture sit between 6-12 hours.</li>
        <li>Dump out 2/3rds of the mixture and start again</li>
        <li>Repeat these steps until you can see the starter getting bubbly and frothy</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Using your starter</h2>
        <p>A good rule of thumb is that your starter is ready to rock and roll when it has doubled in size after4-6 hours.
        Use a rubber band to mark it's level when you first add flour and water to keep track of how active it is. Don't overthink
        this process. Just because you will use your sourdough starter in baking doesn't mean the precision from baking carries over into it's care.

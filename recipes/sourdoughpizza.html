    <h2>A note on baker's percents</h2>
    <p>Understanding and working in baker's percentages—also known as baker's math or 
        formula percentage—is a way to quickly scale up and down recipes, a way to read a
         formula and immediately understand the type of bread it represents,
         and a way to add and remove ingredients without affecting the entire recipe. 
         In short, it allows you to avoid specific measurements and deal with ratios.
        That way you can have pizza for one or pizza for ten using the same recipe. </p>

    <h2>Mixing the dough</h2>
    <p>Let's start by adding our ingredients using the bakers percentage. At this point your starter
        should be ready to go, having doubled in size. First you need to decide how much flour you want to use.
        For the sake of this recipe we will assume you are using 1000grams of flour. This yeilds about 5-6 small to medium pizzas
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 63% water to a tub. In the case of 1000g flour you will be adding 630g water. </li>
        <li>Add 20% starter. In this case 200g starter</li>
        <li>Add .4 % salt. In this case 40g salt</li>
        <li>Add 100% flour. In this case, 1000g</li>
        <li>Knead until all ingredients are mixed thoroughly. The dough should look shaggy at this point</li>
        <li>Let dough sit for 20-30 minutes</li>
        <li>Knead dough again for roughly 5 minutes</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Fermentation stage</h2>
    <p> I hope you have something else to do, we are gonna be waiting a while. The dough needs to rise! Your starter is getting to work.
        The longer you spend fermenting your dough the better flavor it will have. I recommend a minimum of 12 hours using this method. 
        Tempature has a big effect on the dough at this point. You can think of time and tempature as their own ingredients. The higher the 
        tempature the shorter the time. I've found great success and the most delicious dough by using the fridge to my advantage.
        I'll let the dough sit on the counter for a couple of hours and then pop it in the fridge for 2-5 days. It seems extreme,
        but the low tempature of the fridge really slows down the Fermentation process. A long cold ferment means your dough will be 
        bursting with flavor. Try it for yourself. You are looking for your dough to have roughly doubled in size. At that point it is time
        to move on to shaping.
        </p>
        <h2>Shaping your dough</h2>
        <p>Shaping is a complicated process. Watch this video to get an idea of how it's done.</p>

        <p>I recommend using your scale to measure your dough balls out to between 250-325 grams. At this point
            the dough needs another rise, but this one much shorter. The dough will be ready to use after 1-2 hours or can be kept in the fridge or frozen for longer.
            Enjoy your dough!

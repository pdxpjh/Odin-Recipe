    <h2>I'm not kidding when I say "Simple"</h2>
    <p>I'll prove it to you, here's what you'll need.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A jar of nice whole tomatoes. Bianco DiNapoli is my favorite.</li>
        <li>An immersion blender</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>A fine mesh sieve</li>
        <li>Something for umami - fish sauce, worcesteshire, msg (optional)</li>
        <li>A dash of whatever vinegar you have on hand</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Really not much to it! You can probably guess what's going on here but I'll list it out for you.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the can of tomatoes and pulse a couple of times with the immersion blender.</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes have a lot of exra liquid, run them through the seive to drain off some</li>
        <li>Season the strained tomatoes with salt and your choice of umami. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
        <li>Finish with a dash of vinegar. White wine vinegar works well.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>There you have it. A simple sauce recipe!</p>
